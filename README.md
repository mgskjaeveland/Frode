Converted orginal project from servlet to regular java application to support simpler offline generation of documentation. 

Other changes:
 - updated to new version of OWL API
 - removed support for reasoning (partially due to problems when updating OWL API version)
 - using cdnjs and already published css' whenever possible
 - moving remaining essepuntato files to github pages, due to poor uptime
